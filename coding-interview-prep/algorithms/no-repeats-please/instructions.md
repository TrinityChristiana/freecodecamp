Return the number of total permutations of the provided string that don't have repeated consecutive letters. Assume that all characters in the provided string are each unique.

For example, `aab` should return 2 because it has 6 total permutations (`aab`, `aab`, `aba`, `aba`, `baa`, `baa`), but only 2 of them (`aba` and `aba`) don't have the same letter (in this case `a`) repeating.
