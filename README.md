# freeCodeCamp Exercises

Ever since freeCodeCamp announced that they would be adding a Python course I have been very excited to go thorugh it. I have patiently waited and it's finally out and I can't wait to see what cool things I'm about to learn. 

After learning the basics of Python while at Nashville Software school, I am ready to dive deeper into the language to really find out what more I can do. If you want to follow my journey thorugh it all you can follow it this repo. I also plan on going through some of the Front-End Courses and projects that they have so those will also be added to this repo when I start them.
